# ATmega168-ADC
Voltage measurement program for Atmel ATmega88/168/328 microcontrollers

I developed this project a while back to test the analog to digital conversion (ADC) functionality of Atmega168 microcontrollers. I used a
16 x 2 LCD character display to display the voltage measured by the ADC.

In this repo you'll find the schematic diagram of the circuit I built, datasheets for the Atmega168 microcontroller and LCD display and
source code of a driver program to acquire and display voltage measurements on the LCD screen.
